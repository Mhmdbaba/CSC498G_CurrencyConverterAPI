CSC498_Project2_CurrencyConverter_API

-This project is based on a front-end design and 2 APIs.
-First API is used to scrap the API of the website Lira Rate and get the latest rate of the lira.
-Second API is to send the number entered by the user to the database with the latest rate and its calculated value
so the user would have a history of his calculation.
-The front-end consists of two pages, Landing page and Calculator page, linked together.
